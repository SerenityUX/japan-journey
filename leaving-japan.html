            It's the end of this adventure & the beginning of a new one. I've really loved my time in this country and I am incredibly grateful for all of the kind people here who have made my experience here great. I am turning 20 years old in just a few hours. Wow, I'm getting quite old these days. I'm also moving into my first Hacker House in San Francisco. The next 6 months are going to be a wild adventure. I look forward to making one of these recap websites of my experience over the next 6 months, sharing how I was able to break past the dotted line of death and make something that can sustain life. I think you have to suck at something to one day be good at it. I suck at startups rn, but that's just part of the process for me to get good at it.
